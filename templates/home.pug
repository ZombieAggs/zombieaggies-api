            p.
                We're a USU RHA club dedicated to night games and fun on campus. Every semester, we play a week-long 
                game of infection tag starting at 8AM and going until 10PM. Humans try to sneak between classes while
                avoiding Zombies who hunt and pursue their targets. Every night during this week, we meet and play 
                different missions where the Zombies try to capture the Humans while the Humans try to thwart the 
                Zombies.
